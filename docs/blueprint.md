# **App Name**: QIA Impact Engine

## Core Features:

- Parallax Hero Section: A full-screen hero section with a WebP image sequence that animates based on scroll position, creating a cinematic parallax effect.
- Program Variant Switching: Allows users to switch between different program variants (Climate, Food, Social) which updates the hero text content, theme color, and background WebP sequence.
- Content Customization: Enable admins to customize agency name, description, program details (name, subtitle, description, CTAs), and WebP sequence paths via a backend.
- Theme Color Selection: Enables users to change the theme color (brand accent) to customize the website's appearance, applies the theme to the buttons, social media tags and selected carousel button.
- Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Provides a toggle to switch between dark and light mode, updating the background and text colors accordingly.
- Loading Experience: Implements a loading overlay with brand logo and loading bar that ensures the hero section is fully preloaded before revealing it and will also show an overlay when loading another carousel selection.
- Section Navigation: Creates a sticky top navigation bar with links that smooth-scroll to the main sections of the website.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep teal (#2A7A77) evokes trust and innovation, suitable for QIA's mission.
- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#222222) provides a premium, cinematic feel, especially for the default dark mode.
- Accent color: A muted, gold color (#B0976D), used sparingly to call attention to only the most essential on-screen elements without distracting from the program video content.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a serif typeface, for elegance and to signal high end / luxury; body font: 'PT Sans' because its warmth nicely contrasts with the geometric sans-serif 'Playfair' and prevents the site from seeming overly serious; all in all the type will feel elegant but not cold.
- Minimal and monochrome social icons, consistent with the website's clean and modern aesthetic.
- Clean, single-page layout with a full-screen hero section and standard sections for Our Agency, Together, Programs, etc.
- Smooth parallax scrolling and fade-in/out transitions when switching program variants.
